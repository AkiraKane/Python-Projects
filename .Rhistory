##1) Subset Selection Methods
Here we apply the best subset selection approach to the Hitters data. We wish to predict a baseball playerâ€™s Salary on the basis of various statistics associated with performance in the previous year. First of all, we note that the Salary variable is missing for some of the players. The is.na() function can be used to identify the missing observations. It returns a vector of the same length as the input vector, with a TRUE for any elements that are missing, and a FALSE for non-missing elements. The sum() function can then be used to count all of the missing elements.
```{r}
library(ISLR)
fix(Hitters)
names(Hitters)
dim(Hitters)
sum(is.na(Hitters$Salary))
```
Hence we see that Salary is missing for 59 players. The na.omit() function removes all of the rows that have missing values in any variable.
```{r}
Hitters
Hitters=na.omit(Hitters)
dim(Hitters)
```
library(ISLR)
library(ISLR)
install.packages('XQuartz')
fix(Hitters)
names(Hitters)
dim(Hitters)
sum(is.na(Hitters$Salary))
install.packages("x12")
fix(Hitters)
names(Hitters)
dim(Hitters)
sum(is.na(Hitters$Salary))
install.packages("XQuartz")
Hitters
