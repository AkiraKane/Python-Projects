#MapReduce Spark Exercise

For this assignment, our professor gave us skeleton code that required us to fill in the blanks regarding MapReduce and Spark. I inserted comments to the pieces of code that were produced by myself.
The objective of this lab was to learn simple MapReduce and Spark code connecting to a UMich HDFS provided by the professor.
